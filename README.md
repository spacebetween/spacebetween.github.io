# Team Space Between

This is the website of [spacebetween.co.uk](http://spacebetween.co.uk).

## Developing

This site is built running Jekyll on Github pages, for more on how to set that up, read [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

Once you've got bundle and jekyll install, run `$ bundle exec jekyll serve` which will run the site on localhost:4000
