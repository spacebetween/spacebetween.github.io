intro: Channel Freights needed an ecommerce website to sell their freight crossings. This would need to integrate with 3rd party APIs and Braintree.
title: Channel Freights ecommerce system design and build
description: Using modern technologies we've build a custom ecommerce solution to fit with Channel Freights businesss and their user needs. Starting from technical discovery to full custom build we found out a lot about Channel Freights upfront which helped us steer the project.

	<h2>Goal</h2>
	<p>Channel Freights wanted to maximise their margins by reducing the amount of manpower involved in every booking. Also, the new solution should be optimised to service all devices and guest users.</p>
	
	<h2>Kick Off</h2>
	<p>To get the best out of the project we started this with a technical discovery. This meant we spent 2 weeks investigating the best payment provider, how to integrate with the partnered APIs and best to service the customer throughout the flow.</p>
	<p>During this we simplified the solution so that throughout the booking process we only need to speak to a single API, this meant that we could make the website perform at lightening speed!</p>

	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>We opted to build this solution with a React front-end, this would help keep the website moving quickly and make it very easy for us to continue to grow the website. We also went with Braintree as the payment provider as they had the best solution for keeping card details. We integrated a cron job to check periodically for new bookings made by our API and firming them up with the correct provider.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Since going live, the Channel Freights team have managed to drastically increase the amount of bookings they can take. This is because the system handles all of the tasks for them and they only need to get involved with customer inquiries. This has increased the margins on all bookings making for a higher ROI across the entire website.</p>
	
	<h2>Now what</h2>
	<p>We're working with the Channel Freights team to continue to grow their platform. This means suggesting and working on optimisations.</p>
