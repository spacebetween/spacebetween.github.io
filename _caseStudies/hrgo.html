	<h2>Goal</h2>
	<p>HR GO Recruitment needed a site that could be as flexible as they are. They needed to have the ability to quickly create custom pages and then alter the look and feel of the pages.</p>
	<h2>Kick Off</h2>
	<p>Space Between kicked this off with a design sprint, this involved many relevant parties from the HR GO Recruitment team. This means that we could get the stakeholders and other expertise from the business together and work on a solution that would not only solve problems but would be loved by users.</p>
	<p>We created basic wireframes and tested these on customers in the Ashford, Canterbury and Folkestone HR GO Recruitment branches to get true reactions, this meant we could learn quickly and deliver a better ROI for the HR GO Recruitment team.</p>
	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>The end solution was a custom component lead website with a full job board integration all controlled by a modern Umbraco CMS.</p>
	<p>Utilising modern grid layouts we're able to give the HR GO Recruitment team a way to easily build layouts that work perfectly on everything spanning mobile, tablet and desktop computers.</p>
	<p>The fully functioning job board means that HR GO Recruitment customers can sign up for jobs, or leave their information to handled by a recruiter later, meaning that we are able to satisfy the needs of many different user personas. The job board also has SEO optimisations to allow it to perform so will in the search results.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Since the release of the new website, HR GO Recruitment has seen job board usage increase, website bounce rate reduced and hours saved for internal teams.</p>
	<h2>Now what</h2>
	<p>Now that the HR GO Recruitment teams have the flexibility of the new website in place, Space Between can now make better use of their time spent with HR GO Recruitment in optimising the current website to better satisfy the users. This means running regular split test and working with the internal HR GO Recruitment team to make optimisations.</p>
