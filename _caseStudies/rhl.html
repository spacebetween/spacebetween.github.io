			<h2>RHL</h2>
			<p>
				RHL is a recruitment company based in Ashford, Kent. They offer trade jobs worldwide and their belief in placing people first was exactly the reason we worked so well together.
			</p>

			<p>
				Space Between were given the task of redesigning and rebuilding their current website, to come up with something that would work for RHL to show to clients and candidates alike.
			</p>

			<p>
				We have given RHL a solution built on an easily customisable CMS, which means the staff can update content, imagery and add pages. We've also introduced a Job Board which is fed from Broadbean. This makes it incredibly easy for candidates to apply. It also makes it really easy for RHL team to add new jobs to the website.
			</p>

			<p>
				RHL share our people first attitude, this meant we brought the team into the pages, making sure to show the faces and names of everybody that a candidate could potentially speak to. In our user tests, this made candidates feel much more confident in opening up and potentially finding a job.
			</p>

			<p>
				We've enjoyed working with RHL very much, <a href="http://www.rhl.co.uk">click here</a> to see the website.
