	<h2>Goal</h2>
	<p>RHL needed to be able to service it's user around the world while presenting themselves as a sophisticated brand to their clients. RHL believes in placing people first resonated with the Space Between team and became was the driving goal fo the website.</p>
	<h2>Kick Off</h2>
	<p>We started the RHL project with a design meeting, this involves getting people together to run through some pre-designed tiles made by the Space Between team, this gets everybody involved early and gets lots of components signed off in one go. This gives us the flexibility create more components.</p>
	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>We have given RHL a solution built on an easily customizable CMS, which means the staff can update content, imagery and add pages. We've also introduced a Job Board which is fed from Broadbean. This makes it incredibly easy for candidates to apply. It also makes it really easy for RHL team to add new jobs to the website.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Upon launching their new website RHL received great feedback from clients and candidates alike, this feedback was also witnessed in the website metrics as the newly built goals performed much better than expected. They also reaped the rewards of having a fully functional job board in place.</p>
	<h2>Now what</h2>
