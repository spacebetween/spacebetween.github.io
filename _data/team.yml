  title: CEO
  blurb: "As CEO I look after the day-to-day operations at Thnkr. My favorite parts of my job are chatting with our clients and innovating solutions to their problems with the team. I love working with new technology and I'm especially nerdy about angular.js and meteor.js. I've got a pug called Oak, who snores."

  title: Director
  blurb: "I love making things easier for people, I class people as our clients, there users and our team. I'm my happiest when I'm talking to people about the web, tinkering with a new piece of tech, or working on our awesome culture. If I'm not working, I'll be spending time with my better half Brianna, relaxing with a nice ale, or playing video games. Sometimes all at the same time!"
