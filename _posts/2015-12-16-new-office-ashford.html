Since day 1 we have been graciously hosted by HR GO. But as new team we need a place to build a business together. Part of that is being able to have the conversions you need have in a space where everyone feels comfortable saying what they need to say. We need to be able to bring clients to our space and have discussions, meetings and presentations. We can now proudly say we have that space.

It started out as a spare, furniture-packed, room belonging to RHL, just across the road from HR GO. We were graciously given the pick of furniture we wanted from the room. The room was full of the discarded love children from Ikea-Staples. We chose the best suited pieces and then moved the rest into another room that was to become a graveyard for the sad and unslightly children.

A big thanks to Bob for helping us move.

Let's be clear though, we aren't finished with a few appropriated desks and cream wallpaper. We want to evolve this area into place that allows creativity and displays our character. Be on the lookout for more posts in the future.
