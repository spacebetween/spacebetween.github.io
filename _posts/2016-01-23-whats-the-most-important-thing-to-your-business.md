Everybody should ask themselves this question and they should remind themselves of the answer often. From business owners to fresh-faced employees, if you want a business to succeed, you should continually remind yourself of its goals and priorities.

But, unfortunately, I think most people will answer this question incorrectly. Have a think about what the answer to this is for your business.

I’d imagine most people are thinking of their business's product, a top new strategy you may have or maybe even just cold hard cash?

If you’re thinking people, well done, you can stop reading this post, go and make a cup of tea, you’ve earnt it.

People are the most important part of your business. When I say people I mean, pretty much... everybody. Your users, people who don’t use your product, people who have never heard of your product before and, of course, your employees. For the purpose of this, I’m going to focus on your users.

We’re in a new age of business, there’s so much choice for people, that you won't just keep your customers by being the market leader. There’s going to be another brand around the corner ready to disrupt your market, build something better and their goal will be to steal them.

What they can’t do, however, is make your customers forget all the brilliant interactions with your company. The times you’ve refunded without question or honestly said sorry because the customer feels wronged. These are the interactions that your customers will remember and they are the interactions that will help you retain them.

People remember when things go wrong, but what really sticks in people’s mind is when things go great for no reason.

So next time you’re thinking of spending some time on getting yourself some new users. How about focusing on your old customers, give them something to remember.

How about giving them a ring, ask them how they are, thank them for using your services.

It doesn’t need to be focused around selling, not all your actions have to have a bottom line, just spend some time focusing on what might make your users day, or even better, focus on what might make the day of the people listening to you.
