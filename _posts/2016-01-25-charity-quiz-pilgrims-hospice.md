We were invited to a charity quiz hosted by [Stour Chambers](http://www.stourchambers.co.uk) at The Westgate Hall in Canterbury, Kent to raise money for The Pilgrims Hospice.

The quiz was organised by [Kate Kochnari](http://www.stourchambers.co.uk/barristers/kate-kochnari) with the marketing team there, and they asked whether we would donate any prizes for the raffle. In typical techy fashion, we got together and chose a few cool tech prizes:

1. Amazon Fire 7 - This budget tablet is perfect for someone looking for an introduction into mobile computing. It comes with the Amazon App Store and a few pre-installed apps.
2. Chromecast - Google's contribution to the TV dongle market, the Chromecast plugs into the back of your TV through HDMI and is controlled by a smartphone, laptop or tablet. It lets you stream from your laptop or computer and has some pre-installed apps like the BBC iPlayer and youtube.
3. Amazon Fire TV stick - A competitior to the Chromecast, the 'fire stick' works in a similar way but comes with its own remote control. Netflix and iPlayer are installed out-of-the-box.
4. Sailor Jerry's Limited Edition - We thought it wouldn't be a raffle donation without a good bottle of booze...

The quiz included a music round, general knowledge, current affairs, aliases, cities of the world and a picture round. We got off to a flakey start with the aliasses round, but played our joker on the music round and gained a healthy lead. Mike Vigor from Big Blue Dev, a friend of ours at Space Between, has watched more films than we've written lines of code - he carried us through that round.

We didn't expect to win and we had clearly all gone to have some fun as we quickly got a round of drinks in after the demorilizing aliasses round. As the night went on, we noticed that not only were we maintaining a healthy lead on the points, we were also storming ahead of everyone else in how much we were drinking!

After the raffle was drawn they announced they'd made just under Â£1000 for The Pilgrims Hospice!

A great night out. Thanks to [Stour Chambers](http://www.stourchambers.co.uk).
