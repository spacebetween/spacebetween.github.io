If you've been following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Space__Between), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teamSpaceBetween/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq5Ohmf9RVoZ5IlNiawc2JA), you'll have noticed that we've started #AskSB. You can enjoy episode 1 [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ciQgxPNk_eM).

But why have we put our time aside to do this?

As part of starting Space Between, I've spent a lot of my time attending meetups and events with other businesses. The most common trend I've found while attending these events is that people have been given some pretty terrible advice when it comes to anything digital.

People are being told outdated information, unbelievable nonsense or  have just been spouted some bullshit from somebody who's trying to sell them something.

I can't bare speaking to really nice person, who've been told rubbish. So we decided to use a small amount of our week answering people's burning digital questions.

We don't mind what these questions are. So please:

* Ask us how the internet works.
* Ask us how to get a website up and running.
* Ask us how to use social media.
* Ask us... just about anything you want!

We're going to answer these questions as long as people keep asking them. So please, ask us using the comments or #AskSB.

With love,<br/>
Space Between Team.
