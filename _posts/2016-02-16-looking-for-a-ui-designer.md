We're getting busy so we're looking for another great person to join our team.

## What We're Looking For

We believe that to achieve brilliance, you need a brilliant team. We're looking for a front-end developer who's ready to grow with our business. Working closely with every member of the Space Between team, this role comes with room to learn and teach.

Our current tech bread and butter consists of; .NET, Umbraco, Angular.JS, Azure, AWS, Git not forgetting JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

We're up for using the best tech to solve the problem, so we're all for hearing what you've been working with.

## Our expectations

We're happy hearing from people at any stage of their front-end development career, from junior to master. Our only expectation is you have a passion for what you do.

Apart from that

## What We Give You

Our salary is D.O.E, this is because we want to open this role out to as many people as possible.

* Salary - D.O.E
* Your own MacBook Pro

So if you think you could do with a new challenge, or have some more question. Reach out to me at <a href="mailto:luke@spacebetween.io">luke@spacebetween.io</a>.
