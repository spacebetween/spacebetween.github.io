We work in an industry where people are so passionate about what they do, they often spend hours of time outside work, reading, blogging, talking, listening, teaching and learning. Even with all of that passion, it's still extremely hard to keep up with the latest trends.

This involves us investing paid working hours into our employees, for them to use to better themselves.

This isn't a breakthrough in the industry and we're absolutely not the first to do this, Thought Bot sets aside time for <a href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#investment">investment</a>, Atlassian has <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit" target="_blank">Shipit days</a>, in fact, I wrote about the value of R&amp;D time while at <a href="http://hungrygeek.holidayextras.co.uk/2015/03/09/how-we-do-r-and-d-time-at-holiday-extras/" target="_blank">Holiday Extras</a>.

With more people in our industry suffering from <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome" target="_blank">imposter syndrome</a> and with the growing need for programmes such as <a href="http://geekmentalhelp.com/" target="_blakn">Geek Mental Help Week</a>, we're super excited to be joining the ranks of companies able to offer regular R&amp;D time to everybody and to watch their team benefit from it.

We hope to get a lot of learnings from our Investment Time and once we've got these, we'll report back!
