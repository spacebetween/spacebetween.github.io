Hello! I am very very happy to introduce myself as the new junior front end developer for Space Between! I am really excited to be part of this team, and I can't wait to get involved in projects and meet everyone.

A little about myself, I studied IT for two years and specialised in software development in the second year. It was during this time I discovered I had a big passion for coding and I haven't looked back since. Creating beautiful websites is my passion and I am really looking forward to doing just that in my new role! 

Some other things about me, when I am not in the office I enjoy spending my time with friends, whether that be going to gigs supporting my friends band [Teal](https://tealmusick.bandcamp.com), playing games or going to the pub! I also enjoy developing Umbraco sites in my spare time, and I am a huge fan of Nintendo, Star Wars and sleeping :)

I am really excited to be working with the amazing team, and meeting all of our lovely clients!
