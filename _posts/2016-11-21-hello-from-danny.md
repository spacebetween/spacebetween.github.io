Hi! I'm Danny, the newest member of the Space Between!

I'm very excited to be part of such a great team. I am itching to get started on some great projects, meeting some great clients and making new friends!

So a little bit about me...

I'm a programmer! I started learning programming when I was 11 years old, and made my first website that same year. Since then, I have been sucked into the world of the web, and the benefits IT brings to society. I enjoy jumping head-first into a project, and bringing what I can to the table.

When I'm not behind a computer screen I'm likely to be either walking my dog, gaming, reading, or binging a new TV series!
