    <h1>Build</h1>

    <blockquote>
        98% of what gets built today is shi&hellip;
        <cite>Frank Gehry</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Woah there Frank!</p>

    <p>Okay, so Frank Gehry was talking about buildings, but he's not half wrong about, most things are... well, you know.</p>

    <p>We are very proud of the work we do at <a href="/" action="Click here to go back to the home page">Space Between</a>, we fall in that special 2%. We believe this shows in the work we produce, and the reaction users give when they use it.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Agile</h3>

    <p>We've spent a lot of time optimising our processes, we've found that Agile methodologies are our preferred project management style.</p>

    <p>This means that we work in sprints, you've probably already read about our <a href="/process/design.html" action="Read more about design sprints">Design Sprints</a>. We use a similar idea, but a different form of sprint in our build stage. This means that unlike traditional methodologies we can be building while we design, test, and ultimately deploy.</p>

    <p>This means we have a shorter feedback loop meaning a faster delivery and, more importantly, a much better solution.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Modern Technology</h3>

    <p>At Space Between we push the envelope when it comes to modern technology and we're very proud of the fact we get excited about the latest piece of tech.</p>

    <p>We are all tech enthusiasts here, which means in our spare time we're constantly playing with new bits of kit.<p>

    <p>But what does this give you? It's that very love for tech that means we are in the best position to pick the right technology for your solution. We take into account the type of website, the amount of security necessary, the volume of users, the type of product and a load of other variables to come up with what's perfect for you.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-forward"></i> Lightning Fast</h3>

    <blockquote>
        Fast is better than slow.
        <cite>
            <a target="_blank" action="Read more about Googles 10 things we know to be true" href="https://www.google.co.uk/about/company/philosophy/">Google Philiosiphy - 10 things we know to be true</a>
        </cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We couldn't have said it better ourselves and we believe performance is king. From the way we build, to the solutions we deliver, you can be sure that everything has been rigorously optimised to be as quick as possible.</p>

    <p>We've already discussed our use of Agile to help us deliver projects better. But the solutions we deliver are lightning quick as well, your users expect websites that load fast, like, really fast! We can help you beat those expectations.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-code"></i> Code Quality</h3>

    <p>Just like Steve Jobs cared about the look of the circuit boards that nobody could see inside the Apple computers, we care about the code that nobody will ever see.</p>

    <p>This means we adhere to rules when developing our websites. We have a strict list of coding guidelines that dictate how we write code, we then use code reviews to make sure they've been adhered to. For more challenging tasks we even use a technique called pair programming, this means we get two developers to code one task. Well, two heads are better than one.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> We want to involve you</h3>

    <p>We think collaboration is the key to success, working together means we have a much higher chance of coming up with the best solution, after all, you know your product better than we ever could. We invite you to be as involved in the process as possible. You can attend daily 5 minutes conference calls about your project to hear how things are going.</p>

    <p>We've got nothing to hide, we are completely transparent, you'll be able to hear us discussing your product, you'll hear our ideas, you'll be able to get involved with the best ways to solve them. These conversations happen regardless, but unlike other companies, we invite you to them.</p>

    <p>Without going into too many detail that's the main areas of our build phases, feel free to get in touch with us about anything mentioned here.</p>

    <p>Now we've built your product, we can use this in the next stage of our process, the <a href="/process/grow.html" action="Click here to read about the next stage in our process, grow.">Grow Stage.</a></p>
