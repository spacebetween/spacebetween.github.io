		<p>We couldn't agree with Steve more at <a href="/" action="Click here to go back to the home page">Space Between</a>. This is why we find the most valuable way to kick off a project is by running a design sprint. This is the part of a digital development process that a lot of agencies miss off, but it's an absolute necessity for delivering you a successful digital solution.</p>

		<p>We use our own custom flavour of the design sprint developed at <a href="http://www.gv.com" target="_blank" class="anchor-bland" action="Click to find out more about Google Ventures">Google Ventures (or GV)</a>.</p>

		<p>We break sprints down into the following 6 stages:</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-question"></i> Prepare</h3>

		<p>The key to the success of this process is getting the right people in the room. This should be a member of each team at your company, if you have engineers, we should get one in, if you've got sales reps, bring one of them as well. Everybody will have knowledge on an area, and you won't be able to get that out of them if they're not around. So firstly make sure you clear everybody's calendars.</p>

		<p>There's a bunch of other parts to prep for, but we'll help out with that when we get to it.</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download</h3>

		<p>As we've said before, everybody in the room has different experiences and knowledge, all of which might, and probably will be, very be helpful.</p>

		<p>We've got a few exercises we find really helpful when getting people to share this information, from laying out what you and your competitors currently have, to team interviews and everything in between. We keep these discussions short (maximum of 10 minutes) this keeps everything moving while making sure everybody is interested and happy.</p>

		<p>We start at the beginning, meaning that even if people in the room are familiar with the concept, it gets them thinking as a beginner, which the vast majority of your users will be.</p>

		<p>Now we've got everybody thinking as a beginner, it's much easier to encourage everybody to have a &#8220;How might we&hellip;&#8221; approach, these together ensure we get some juicy ideas.</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Sketch</h3>

		<p>Everybody loves the Sketch phase, although most think they won't.</p>

		<p>On Sketch day we try and keep everybody separated, this allows people to go into maximum detail but minimising the amount of design by committee, which at this stage isn't what we want.</p>

		<p>Again we come with tricks up our sleeves. We use 4 different techniques to help people, these are: Notes, Mind Map, Crazy 8s, and Storyboarding.</p>

		<p>After this is completed we critique and use weighted voting to find the best ideas from the bunch.</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> Decision Time</h3>

		<p>At this point in the process we'll have ideas flowing around, which is exactly what we want, but that does come with some difficulties. We now have to decide which ones to take into the prototype phase.</p>

		<p>We'll spend today finalising what we are going to make in our prototype session, working out the storyboard and planning.</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-paint-brush"></i> Prototype</h3>

		<p>We have tips and tricks to make this day work perfectly. We split the room into teams, this means everybody has their own area to look after.</p>

		<p>Nothing gets coded at this point, our prototypes can be built in Keynote, PowerPoint, Photoshop etc&hellip; but we can help with all of that at the time.</p>

		<p>At the end of this section, we'll have had a great looking and workable prototype, which we can show to your users.</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Interview</h3>

		<p>At this stage we show your prototypes to real people, this can be your customers or people that fit into your demographic. We will hold 1-on-1 interviews where we will show your users the prototypes and collect feedback.</p>

		<p>Just like in the real word, some of our ideas will have been brilliant, some will fall short. But by taking this process, we can find all that out before we actually start coding.</p>

		<blockquote>
			There are three responses to a piece of design â€“ yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for.
			<cite>Milton Glaser</cite>
		</blockquote>

		<p>As you can see, the process is lengthy, but the learnings outway any time spent. You'll have a much clearer understanding of your customers, your users and the people in your team.</p>

		<p>Now we've collected all of this data, we can use this in the next stage of our process, the <a href="/process/build.html" action="Click here to read about the next stage in our process, build.">Build Stage.</a></p>
