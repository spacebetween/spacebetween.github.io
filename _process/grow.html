    <h1>Grow</h1>

    <blockquote>
        Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together.
        <cite>James Cash Penney, Founder of JCPenney</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here at <a href="/" action="Click here to go back to the home page">Space Between</a> we believe those forces are you, your users and just the right amount of us.</p>

    <p>The Grow stage of our process is where the excitement can really happen, this is the part of the process that can go on for as long as you want. We define what your goals are for your business, and we spend time making that happen.</p>

    <p>We like to see ourselves as the catalyst for your business, at the end of the day, you know your product better than we ever could. We want to take the knowledge you have, the digital experience we have and mix in the passion we all have to make the perfect end product for your users.</p>

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Here is a list of areas we've had measurable success before:</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> User testing</h3>

    <p>The most important group of people on the internet is without a doubt your users. </p>

    <p>The first thing to remember is who your intended audience is, your users. What they think about your website is the single most important thing. That is why at Space Between we use actual User Testing wherever possible.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Just because nobody complains doesnâ€™t mean all parachutes are perfect.

    </blockquote>

    <p>It's very hard to put yourself in your user's shoes, this is because you know so much about your product and website. You know exactly how it should be used, this is why the best way to learn what your users think, is to speak to them.</p>

    <p>We use a variety of techniques to get your users' feedback, from asking strangers in the street to try out prototypes, to getting people online to try your product. But the best way to test your product is to invite your actual users and customers to get their opinions. That way we can make exactly what they want and, ultimately, something they will love.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO)</h3>

    <p>One of the most common ways of adding real value to your business is through Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO for short). The goal of CRO is to increase the value of your website, by increasing the percentage of visitors performing your website's goal.</p>

    <p>A few examples of areas we've increased:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Basket value of an e-commerce website.</li>
        <li>The conversion rate of a booking flow.</li>
        <li>Website registrations.</li>
        <li>Sign ups to an email database.</li>
        <li>Posts read on a blog.</li>
        <li>Time spent on a website.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because CRO is a very personal experience, <a href="tel:{{site.phone}}" target="Call us now">have a chat</a> with us to find out how it can benefit you.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-user-plus"></i> Digital Presence</h3>

    <p>Growing your digital presence is extremely important, the more people feel you, relate to you and most importantly remember you, the more likely they are to convert into a customer.</p>

    <p>We've helped companies with this in many different ways, here are a few examples of areas we've helped:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Helping clients build and monetise strong social channels.</li>
        <li>Working with clients to reframe how they speak to users.</li>
        <li>Help developing strong recognisable brands.</li>
        <li>Helping business improve their Search Engine Optimisation or SEO.</li>
        <li>Steering people better with Pay Per Click or PPC advertising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-diamond"></i> Consulting</h3>

    <blockquote>
        Innovation needs to be part of your culture. Consumers are transforming faster than we are, and if we don't catch up, we're in trouble.
        <cite>Ian Schafer</cite>            
    </blockquote>

    <p>The best way to look at your brand is with fresh eyes, it's also the hardest way.</p>

    <p>This is why we are brought into businesses. We offer ourselves as that fresh set of eyes that everybody will benefit from. We help out with anything from Business Process Reengineering to day to day questions about digital and the web.</p>

    <p>We do this by becoming a member of your team. We watch, listen, learn and take on board everything around us. Then help you optimise your processes, brand, website or even come up with something completely new.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-tick"></i> Uptime</h3>

    <p>You can't grow without solid foundations, this is why we take a huge amount of care in ensuring your website is kept online.</p>

    <p>We use a variety of tools and automated tests to ensure that your website always has the lights on, that your users aren't infuriated and that we can cope with vast influxes of traffic.</p>

    <p>We'll also keep logs of your website's activity and keep you constantly updated about what's going on.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> Measurable</h3>

    <blockquote>
        Every line is the perfect length if you don't measure it.
        <cite>Marty Rubin</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We've saved the best till last. This is our client's favourite point.</p>

    <p>We're really big data geeks, we absolutely love measuring the work we do, and reporting that back to you.</p>

    <p>We think all good business decisions comes from good data. This is why we keep data at the centre of everything we do. Whether it's from split testing our ideas and opinions, or deciding the next direction to move your business. Data is the guide.</p>
