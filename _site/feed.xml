        <title>Hello From Thnkr!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahoy there, we are Thnkr!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a group of web enthusiasts based in Ashford, Kent in England. We are happiest when we are helping people interact better with websites, and pushing the web to its extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided we wanted to use our passions to help as many as possible. With that in mind, we started Thnkr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission, a simple one, is to put people first! We define people as our clients, their users and our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making websites that are simple to use, by understanding the people who will be using them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speaking the right language, for the people in the room. We don’t want to use unnecessary jargon, it doesn’t make anybody feel good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We allow you to be a part of everything we do, so that together, we can make something truly amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to work with as many people as possible, so that together, we can make a true impact for your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With love,&lt;br /&gt;
Thnkr Team&lt;/p&gt;
