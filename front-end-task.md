# Front End Task

If you've been sent this link then we would like to better understand how you work, to do this we'd like you to undertake a small assignment.

At Space Between, we use a variety of front end technologies to develop rich and responsive interfaces and have developed an assignment to help us assess a candidate's abilities in this broad discipline.

The task is to consume a public [JSON API Feed](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=space&tagmode=all&format=json) ([documentation](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/)) and display the resulting data according to these annotated wireframes - <a href="/assets/images/task/feDevTask-under800px.png" target="_blank" download>under 800px</a> and <a href="/assets/images/task/feDevTask-over800px.png" target="_blank" download>over 800px</a>.

It should only take a few hours and there's no deadline. You won't be judged on the completion time, so there's no rush, just let us know once it's completed.

* Layout should match the provided wireframes
* Look and feel is up to you, flat colours for borders and background are all that's expected
* Site should use responsive techniques to ensure it works on a range of devices
* Must be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (SCSS or Less are encouraged)
* Use any 3rd party libs you like (as long as they have a weak copyleft license)

We understand your time is precious, but if you do feel like going that extra mile then we've included a few optional enhancements below which you might like to consider. Or perhaps you may want to simply spec out one or two of these features for us, rather than actually implementing them.

* Search items e.g. a free-text search box where text entered is matched against tags
* Infinite scrolling or "Load more" style pagination
* Google +1 button for results
* Build process for generating production-ready code
* Tests (unit tests, e2e tests, etc)
* Also, feel free to include any other features that you think the app could benefit from.

We'd like to see how you write code so try to keep it simple, but don't be afraid to add some flair to show off what you can do. Ideally you would upload your repository (to GitHub or similar) so that we can have a poke around.

We're looking forward to seeing what you produce! Thanks for your time. This task was heavily influenced from great guys at <a href="https://p.ota.to/" target="_blank">Potato</a>
