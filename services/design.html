	<h2>Design</h2>
	<p>Colours, stripes, feature rich, minimalist - whatever your style, let us create the design to match.</p>

	<h3>Design for web</h3>
	<p>Stand out from the crowd with a design which truly reflects your brand. With intelligent design and a flair for the creatively unique, our team will ensure that when people visit your site, they remember it.</p>

	<h3>App design</h3>
	<p>When it comes to mobile apps, design plays a big part in making sure that it represents your brand - and rewards your users. Through bespoke development and custom design, we can ensure that every aspect of your app is designed to be the perfect representation of your business.</p>

	<h3>UX</h3>
	<p>User experience is all about the people who use your site the most - your users. A great experience is about more than just the way something looks; it’s about having impact, and value, and creating a pleasurable moment in time. Through tracking, user research and diving deep into your coding, we can create the best experience for your customers.</p>

	<h3>User research</h3>
	<p>Every business is different - and so are their customers. That’s why user research is a big part of our design process at Space Between. It helps us to understand what makes your customers tick, what gets them going, and what’s going to make them click the little red button in the top corner of the screen. And no one wants that, do they?</p>

	<h3>UI</h3>
	<p>The space where user meets machine. Through extensive coding, research and experience, our team of code-loving creatives ensure that your app or website meets all your functional and design requirements. Who says you can’t have brains and beauty?</p>

	<h3>Invest in staff</h3>
	<p>Great work starts with a great team, and we are incredibly proud of the team we have assembled at Space Between. By regularly attending events, conferences and meetings around the world, we ensure that each member is fully clued up on the latest developments in the tech world in order to offer the best possible service for all of our customers.</p>
