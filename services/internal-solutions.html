	<h2>Internal Solutions</h2>
	<p>Digital design and development can be used to create internal solutions that help your business to be more efficient, streamlined, and just generally make life a little easier for you and your team.</p>


	<p>Our knowledge of tech means we can create a bespoke solution for a range of internal processes, whilst our inquisitive nature ensures it also meets the needs of all your internal stakeholders.</p>


	<p>If you work on a project with us, we’ll take you through our three-step process:</p>


	<u>Design</u>
	<p>In the first phase, we’ll scope out your internal solution with everyone who will be invested in it by carrying out a design sprint. This creates a firm foundation on which to progress to the build phase.</p>


	<u>Build</u>
	<p>Using an agile approach, once we have the foundations set, we’ll build your solution and work closely with you throughout the whole process to ensure we’re creating a product you and your team can be proud of.</p>


	<u>Growth</u>
	<p>Feedback is a gift and we want to know that the internal solution we’ve created is going to do the job. During the final phase, we’ll carry out user testing before handing the finished product over to you.</p>


	<p>If you need some help developing a digital internal application or online solution, give us a call and let’s see how we can make it happen.</p>
