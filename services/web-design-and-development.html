	<h2>Web design and development</h2>
	<p>At Space Between, our focus is on <strong>beautifully designed, customisable websites</strong> that serve your users as well as your business.</p>

	<p>We’ll work through the <a href="/process/design">design</a>, <a href="/process/build">build</a> and <a href="/process/grow">growth</a> processes of creating a new website with the people in front of, and behind, the website, ensuring the platform is functional from the point of go live, but can easily be updated and adapted once we’ve handed it over to you.</p>

	<p>Our focus is always on the User Experience (UX), meaning our goal is to make each user’s interaction with your website as effortless as possible. Your website will be created using responsive web design so no matter what device it’s viewed on, the user experience and the functionality remains the same. </p>

	<p>Whilst the UX takes care of the people interacting with your website, what about the ones responsible for adding and updating content? Our solutions are created with ease of use for the content creators too so they can get on with what they do best, whilst we focus on optimising your website.</p>
